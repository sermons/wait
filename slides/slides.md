## Isaiah 40:26-31

---
26 
Lift up your eyes and look to the **heavens**: <br/>
Who **created** all these?

He who brings out the **starry host** one by one <br/>
and **calls forth** each of them by name.

Because of his great **power** and mighty strength,  <br/>
not one of them is missing. 

---
27 
Why do you **complain**, Jacob? <br/>
Why do you say, Israel,

“My way is **hidden** from the Lord; <br/>
my cause is **disregarded** by my God”? 

---
28 
Do you not know? <br/>
Have you not heard? 

The Lord is the **everlasting** God, <br/>
the **Creator** of the ends of the earth. 

He will not grow **tired** or weary,  <br/>
and his **understanding** no one can fathom. 

---
29 
He gives **strength** to the weary  <br/>
and increases the **power** of the weak.

30 
Even **youths** grow tired and weary, <br/>
and young men **stumble** and fall; 

---
31 
but those who **hope** in the Lord <br/>
will **renew** their strength. 

They will **soar** on wings like eagles;  <br/>
they will **run** and not grow weary, <br/>
they will **walk** and not be faint.
