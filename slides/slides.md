# Opening **Question**

[###](#/outline "secret")

[26](# "ref")
Lift up your eyes and look to the **heavens**: <br/>
Who **created** all these?

He who brings out the **starry host** one by one <br/>
and **calls forth** each of them by name.

Because of his great **power** and mighty strength,  <br/>
not one of them is missing.

[Isaiah 40:26 (NIV) (p.1/5)](# "ref")

---
[27](# "ref")
Why do you **complain**, Jacob? <br/>
Why do you say, Israel,

“My way is **hidden** from the Lord; <br/>
my cause is **disregarded** by my God”?

[Isaiah 40:27 (NIV) (p.1/5)](# "ref")

---
[28](# "ref")
Do you not know? <br/>
Have you not heard?

The Lord is the **everlasting** God, <br/>
the **Creator** of the ends of the earth.

He will not grow **tired** or weary,  <br/>
and his **understanding** no one can fathom.

[Isaiah 40:28 (NIV) (p.1/5)](# "ref")

---
[29](# "ref")
He gives **strength** to the weary  <br/>
and increases the **power** of the weak.

[30](# "ref")
Even **youths** grow tired and weary, <br/>
and young men **stumble** and fall;

[Isaiah 40:29-30 (NIV) (p.1/5)](# "ref")

---
[31](# "ref")
but those who **hope** in the Lord <br/>
will **renew** their strength.

They will **soar** on wings like eagles;  <br/>
they will **run** and not grow weary, <br/>
they will **walk** and not be faint.

[Isaiah 40:31 (NIV) (p.1/5)](# "ref")
